Config file :
-------------
- "*.cub" --> is ".cub" accepted or not ?
* meaning in bash is any character or none
however ".blabla" is not a file with extension blabla, but an hidden file
When I create a file name ".cub" and then try "rm *.cub" --> no such file
But if I create a file "cub" and then try "rm *cub" -> it deletes the right file
it works with any command. bash and zsh.
From this tests I conclude that ".cub" is not acceptable.
- Space in the texture path --> map\ .cub or "map .cub" is ok in bash. It fucks my
parsing.
- Quotes in the texture path --> '"config.cub"' should be accepted as config.cub
and not "config.cub"
- Spaces in rgb --> "F  200    ,  23,255   " might be acceptable, but not for
texture_path because its a single peace of info
