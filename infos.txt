Config file :
-------------
- "*.cub" --> is ".cub" accepted or not ?
* meaning in bash is any character or none
however ".blabla" is not a file with extension blabla, but an hidden file
When I create a file name ".cub" and then try "rm *.cub" --> no such file
But if I create a file "cub" and then try "rm *cub" -> it deletes the right file
it works with any command. bash and zsh.
From this tests I conclude that ".cub" is not acceptable.
- Space in the texture path
such as map\ .cub or "map .cub" is ok in bash. 
I dont handle theses.
- Quotes in the texture path --> '"config.cub"' should be accepted as config.cub
and not "config.cub". I accept one peer of quote (double or simple).
- Spaces in rgb --> "F  200    ,  23,255   " might be acceptable, but not for
texture_path because its a single peace of info
- Spaces that be part the texture path : i dont handle bc of ft_split(' ').

MAP :
-----
	- I decided to :
		- make all lines the same lenght (the longest)
		- turn extra char of enlarged lines to spaces
		- transform spaces into char '2'
	--> All maps are rectangle and no problem of wall for shorter line
	- Exactly one player pos (one of : N,S,E,W)
	- No empty lines are accepted within the map (or after)
-------> Eric's idea : resize la map at longest line with spaces. Do not replace
space by 1, just check that space are surrounded (from all sides) by space or 
wall, never 0 or player pos
and finally check that the ractangle map is surrounded by walls

MLX BASICS : 
------------
	- input convention : /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
	- events : /usr/include/X11/X.h
	- Endian : for portability will be checking it with : 
			int n=1; *(char *)&n = 1 ? little (most sign left) : big (most sign right)
